👋 Hi, I’m Hrishith Raj Reddy Malgireddy

👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack Development (MERN), AI/ML, and secure software systems

🌱 I have experience as a Research Assistant at the University of Missouri, building React and React Native applications, implementing backend APIs with Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, and FastAPI, and managing SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases

💻 I also served as a Teaching Assistant for an Advanced Cybersecurity course, gaining hands-on experience with security best practices, risk assessment, and secure coding
