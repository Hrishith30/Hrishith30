👋 Hi, I’m Hrishith Raj Reddy Malgireddy
👀 I’m interested in Full-Stack Development (MERN), AI/ML, and secure software systems
🌱 I’m currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of Missouri, building React and React Native applications, implementing backend APIs with Express and Node.js, and managing SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases
💻 I focus on user-centered, secure, and maintainable software, with experience in healthcare data (FHIR, HIPAA) and cloud/DevOps tools (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
